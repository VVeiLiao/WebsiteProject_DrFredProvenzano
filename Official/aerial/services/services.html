										<h2 class="major">Comprehensive Psychological & Neuropsychological Evaluations</h2>
										<p>We provide comprehensive evaluations of cognitive and psychological issues that affect learning, memory, executive functioning and behavior that affect functioning at school and in the home.  These include recommendations for intervention and accommodations as appropriate for school-aged children and older.  For high school, college and graduate students, this may include recommendations for accommodations for college and graduate/professional entrance exams and for college and graduate level classes. </p>

										<p>These evaluations typically involve a diagnostic interview, review of records, and two or more morning testing sessions, followed by a feedback session and report.  It may also include classroom observations and/or phone consultations or meetings with school or health care professionals. </p>

										<h2 class="major">Assessment of Giftedness</h2>
										<p>We have been providing assessments for qualification for gifted programs for over 30 years. These assessments have been for both private schools such as The Evergreen School, Seattle Country Day School, Open Window School, and University Child Development School (UCDS), as well as the Seattle Public School’s Highly Capable Program and other public school programs.</p>

										<p>For intellectual assessments:
											<ul>
												<li>the Wechsler scales (WPPSI-IV, WISC-V, and WAIS-IV)</li>
												<li>the Stanford-Binet, 5th Ed. (SB-V)</li>
											</ul>
										</p>


										<p>For reading and math achievement testing:
											<ul>
												<li>the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test, 3rd Ed. (WIAT-III)</li>
												<li>the Woodcock-Johnson Psychoeducational Battery, 4th Ed. (WJ-IV)</li>
											</ul>
										</p>

										<p>Appointments for assessment of giftedness are typically two hours in length.  They involve 5-10 minutes of getting acquainted, 80-90 minutes of testing (with a 5 to10-minute break about 50 minutes into the session), and then finishing with 20-30 minutes to discuss the results with the parents.  This discussion also addresses options for school placement.  The academic testing assessment follows a similar schedule but may be from one to two hours in length, depending on the age and work pace of the child. You are welcome to bring a snack for your child’s break.  Assessments are only scheduled in the mornings, when your child is fresher and we can get a more valid measure of intellectual aptitude. </p>

										<h2 class="major">Psychotherapy and Counseling</h2>
										<p>Dr. Provenzano provides individual and family counseling and psychotherapy services for pre-adolescents, adolescents and adults.  His orientation is a blend of cognitive-behavioral, strategic systems, and solutions-focused therapeutic approaches.  He also blends in developmental and social psychological perspectives. Treatment issues often focus on:</p>

										<ul>
											<li>Anxiety and/or depression management</li>
											<li>Organization, executive functioning, and AD/HD interventions</li>
											<li>Anger management</li>
											<li>Parenting</li>
											<li>Couples issues</li>
											<li>Stress Management & Relaxation</li>
										</ul>

										<p>
											The 50-55 minute sessions typically address the problems and concerns, but are also oriented toward determining actions for clients to practice between sessions to bring about the changes they are seeking in their lives.  Sessions usually occur on a weekly basis until the goals are reached, and then often taper off to alternate weeks to maintain the progress until the client feels independent in their new patterns of thinking and behavior.

										<h3>Gifted Assessments</h3>

										<p>
											IQ and achievement testing required for school admissions is not covered by insurance and therefore payment is due at time of service.
										</p>

										<h3>Insurance</h3>

										<p>
											As of May, 2019, Dr. Provenzano is a preferred provider for Premera Blue Cross, Regence Blue Shield, and the Kaiser Permanente Access PPO Plan.  His office will work with you to explore your coverage.  It is impossible for us to know what your coverage will be when you call to schedule, as plans and policies vary widely even within the same company. For these contracted networks, we will bill the companies directly. Any out-of-pocket expenses, such as co-pays, co-insurances, and deductibles will be the responsibility of the client. 
										</p>

										<p>
											Our office does not accept Aetna, Cigna, United Healthcare, MHN, Value Options, all Group Health plans except the Kaiser Access PPO Plan, Medicare, Medicaid, or any of the Apple Healthcare plans. If you have one of these insurance plans we will not bill the insurance company. We will instead take payment from the client directly.  It is the responsibility of the client if they seek to get reimbursement from their insurance company. We can provide you with receipts and proper procedure and diagnosis coding. 
										</p>

										<h3>Scheduling Fee</h3>

										<p>
											Gifted Assessments require a $100.00 scheduling fee at the time that the first appointment is scheduled.  Comprehensive Evaluations require a $250.00 scheduling fee. This fee is non-refundable and is credited toward payment of the scheduled service. However, it is forfeited in the case of missed, cancelled or rescheduled appointments.
