										<h2 class="major">Allowance: Teaching Children Financial Responsibility</h2>

										<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whether your family is financially comfortable or your budget is tight, you need to help your children develop money management skills so that they can grow up to be successful and responsible adults. No matter how much or how little money your children earn as adults, they will need to know how to live within their means to avoid money problems.</p>

										<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An allowance gives your children experience with managing money, setting spending priorities, and budgeting for expensive items. It not only helps them to appreciate the power of money, but also the limits and consequences of fiscal behavior.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Anger Management For Teens</h2>

										<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There's no denying it. Everyone is likely to experience anger. A recent study found that adults feel anger, from moderate annoyance to rage, on the average of six times a day. Although the rate for children and adolescents has not been reported, we can assume that they are also likely to experience anger frequently. </p>

										<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Anger also has a positive side. We feel angry when we feel threatened or wronged, and it gives us extra energy to deal with the problem. In that respect, we're not unlike humans from eons ago, or even different from most other animals. Anger is part of what is knwon as the <i>generalized alarm response</i>, preparing us to threaten, fight, or run away (the three primitive and basic ways to solve a problem).</p>

										<h2 class="major">Defusing Anger: When Someone Else is Angry</h2>
										<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Anger is a common and natural experience, occurring for most people several times each day. It can have the positive and adaptive value of energizing us to solve the problems that generated the anger.</p>

										<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; However, when other people are angry, they can present a risk to anyone around them. Their problem solving may be primitive and reactive, and they may not fully consider the consequences of their behavior. Since angry people cannot always be trusted to act with good judgment, they may present a risk of violence to themselves or to others. Even if we are not the focus of the person's anger, we still feel tense and wary when we are near them because the angry person may still lash out in some impulsive way.

									<h2 class="major">Gifted Education: Guidelines for Parents</h2>
										<p>
											&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While we often think of <i>gifted</i> as the same as <i>smart</i>, the term <i>gifted</i> refers to a broad range of superior talent and creativity. Gifted individuals display high levels of curiosity and concentration, can generate novel ideas and make quick and broad conceptual connections, develop new skills and abilities early and rapidly, and show exceptional reasoning and memory. Their advanced awareness and problem solving can support social maturity and a highly developed sense of humor. They often show a wide array of interests and can delve deeply into certain subjects. They often prefer to discover answers for themselves rather than be fed information, and love to explore elaborations, implications, and generalizations. Their talents may extend to language, perception, athletics, music, visual arts, or leadership domains.

										<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even though most parents in the United States require their children to perform some form of chores, you may often ask yourself why bother? It sometimes seems that it takes more time and effort to supervise children through the chores than it would take to do them yourself. Still, performing household chores can play several very important roles in your child's development.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Myths about Testing for Gifted Education Programs</h2>

										<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In late October or early November of 2017, the Seattle School District amended their procedures for appealing qualification decisions for the districtâ€™s Highly Capable programs.  One of the changes involves setting much higher qualifying scores on tests administered by independent psychologists versus qualifying scores on tests administered by district examiners. Those rules indicate that students can continue to qualify for the Highly Capable Cohort with scores at or above the 98th percentile on a test of cognitive abilities and 95th percentile on tests of reading and math achievement if they are administered by school district examiners, but the bar for test scores administered by independent psychologists is at or above the 99.6th percentile for all three domains: cognitive abilities, reading, and math. </p>

										<h2 class="major">Test Scores: A Guide to Understanding And Using Test Results</h2>
										<p> By Down P. Flanagan, PhD, & Lenny F. Caltabiano St. John's University</p>
										<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When a student takes either an individually or group-administered standardized test at school, the results are made available to both parents and teachers. It is important that parents and teachers understand the meaning of scores that come from standardized tests. This handout provides a description of common terms used to describe test performance. You are also encouraged to refer to handouts on Psychological Reports (Flanagan & Caltabiano) and Intellectual Assessment (Ortiz & Lella) to gain a better understanding of the evaluation process (See "Resources").</p>
